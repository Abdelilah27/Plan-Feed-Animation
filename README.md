# Plan-Feed-Animation

A beautiful Instagram-inspired UI screen built with Jetpack Compose, implementing the animation concept from [Unfold's Plan Instagram Feed Intro](https://60fps.design/shots/unfold-plan-instagram-feed-intro-animation).

## Features

- **Inspired by Unfold's animation**: Recreating their stunning Instagram feed planning animation concept
- **Animated Profile Section**:
  - Gradient-border profile picture reveal
  - Sequential placeholder text animations
  - Smooth transitions

- **Dynamic Image Grid**:
  - Golden spiral entry pattern (inspired by Unfold)
  - Physics-based grid assembly
  - Interactive image swapping animation
  - Subtle floating effect

- **Authentic UI Elements**:
  - Instagram story gradient borders
  - Animated buttons
  - Smooth transitions

## Animation Implementation Details

This implementation recreates key aspects of Unfold's animation concept:

1. **Golden Spiral Entry**:
   - Images enter along a Fibonacci spiral pattern
   - Each image has a staggered delay
   - Natural easing for organic movement

2. **Grid Assembly**:
   - Images smoothly transition from spiral to grid
   - Spring physics for natural settling
   - Depth effects with scale and rotation

3. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Subtle floating animation when idle
   - Image swap animation when triggered
   - Smooth state transitions

## Technologies Used

- Jetpack Compose
- Kotlin
- Android Animation APIs
- Material 3 Design
- Custom physics-based animations
